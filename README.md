<http://dperrymorrow.github.com/example-backbone-app/>

Very basic app showing how to use backbone, require and node together. Comments also shows how to use socket.io
Server side crud handled with node. Data is saved in a non persistent store on the server.
It lets you create, read, update, delete notes, all with hashtag urls via a Backbone.js router.
